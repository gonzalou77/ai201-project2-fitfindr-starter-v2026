Your MCP server. ← UNIT 4, MILESTONE 1

Right now your tools only exist inside your own program. Nothing else can reach
them. MCP is an agreed shape you wrap a tool in so that anything speaking the
same protocol can call it — your agent today, a different agent tomorrow,
someone else's app after that.

**You're moving one tool. Not three.** The point is to see the seam.
`search_listings` is the one to move: it doesn't call the model, so nothing is
slow and nothing changes between runs while you're learning the shape.

    python mcp_server.py        starts the server (it will just sit there — that's right)
    python mcp_client.py        asks the server what it offers

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TODO — register one tool.

Uncomment the block below and fill it in. Three things matter:

  1. **The name.** Exactly what your agent will ask for.

  2. **The description.** This is the part that isn't code and matters most.
     Write it before you look at the example. You are not writing it for your
     agent — you're writing it for an agent someone else builds, that will
     never see your implementation. That isn't hypothetical; it's what every
     MCP server on the registry is.

     Two things to get right: name units and types ("price" is ambiguous,
     "max_price, in whole dollars" isn't), and state the empty case. Last unit
     the empty case was on your spec sheet for your loop's benefit. Here it's
     part of a published contract.

  3. **The typed inputs.** These come straight from your Tool Inventory. If the
     types here don't match your README, one of the two is wrong — fix it.

Then point your agent at it. In `run_agent()`, swap the direct call:

    results = search_listings(description, size, max_price)

for the MCP one:

    from mcp_client import call_tool
    results = call_tool("search_listings", {
        "description": description,
        "size": size,
        "max_price": max_price,
    })

**What comes back should not change.** If it does, that difference is your
first clue about what your tool was really returning before.

🛑 Stop rule: if this isn't connecting after 40 minutes, stop. Keep your direct
call, and write down in your README exactly where it broke — the error text and
the last thing that worked. Then carry on to Milestone 2. Everything after this
works with a direct call, and **a documented failure earns the point in full.**

) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Searches a catalogue of 40 secondhand clothing listings by keyword and
    returns the best matches. `description` is free text such as "vintage
    graphic tee"; a listing matches if it shares at least one word with it in
    its title, description, category, or style tags, and more shared words rank
    higher. Words are compared after simple plural stripping ("jackets" matches
    "jacket"), and "trainers" is treated as sneakers and "tshirt" as tee; other
    synonyms ("sweater" for "sweatshirt") are not recognised. `size` is optional: a label such as "M", "S/M", "W30", or "US 8",
    compared case-insensitively against whole parts of the listing's size, so
    "M" matches "S/M" but not "XL", and "8" matches "US 8" but not "US 8.5".
    `max_price` is optional: the highest price in US dollars, inclusive;
    listings with no price are excluded when it is set.

    Returns a list of up to 10 listing objects, best match first. Each has id,
    title, description, category (tops, bottoms, outerwear, shoes, or
    accessories), style_tags (list of strings), size, condition, price (number,
    US dollars), colors (list of strings), brand (string, or null when
    unbranded), and platform. Returns an empty list when nothing matches —
    never an error.

    Writes a short, postable social-media caption (two to four sentences) for a
    secondhand clothing find, using a language model, so the wording differs
    between calls. `outfit` is the outfit suggestion text the caption should
    draw on. `new_item` is one listing object as returned by search_listings
    (it needs title, price in US dollars, and platform; a null or missing price
    is handled — the caption says the price wasn't listed).

    Returns the caption as a string. If `outfit` is empty or only whitespace it
    returns a short message saying there is no fit card yet, not an error. If
    the model can't be reached the call fails with an error.

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two notes on the block above.
#
# The registered name is the *function* name — so the block above registers
# "search_listings", which is exactly what call_tool("search_listings", ...)
# asks for. That is also why the import at the top of this file brings the real
# implementation in under an alias: without it, the registered function and the
# one it calls would be the same name, and the tool would call itself.
#
# FastMCP builds the input schema from your type hints, which is why the hints
# are not optional here. `description: str` becomes a required string;
# `max_price: float | None = None` becomes an optional number. Getting these
# wrong is the most common reason a call is rejected.
